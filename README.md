##  Project Overview

This project performs comprehensive **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a cars price dataset containing 8,128 car listings. The analysis includes data preprocessing, statistical analysis, correlation studies, and multiple types of visualizations to uncover insights about factors affecting car prices.

### Key Objectives:
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing
- Generate descriptive statistics
- Conduct correlation analysis
- Create professional visualizations (Statistical, Relational, Categorical)
- Communicate insights through data-driven storytelling

##  Getting Started

### Option 1: Google Colab (Recommended)

1. **Open the notebook in Google Colab**:
   - Click the "Open in Colab" button or
   - Upload `Cars_Price_Analysis_Complete.ipynb` to Google Colab

2. **Upload the dataset**:
   ```python
   from google.colab import files
   uploaded = files.upload()  # Upload cars_price.csv
   ```

3. **Run all cells**:
   - Go to `Runtime` → `Run all`

### Option 2: Local Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/cars-price-analysis.git
   cd cars-price-analysis
   ```

2. **Install required packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scipy scikit-learn jupyter
   ```

3. **Run the notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Cars_Price_Analysis_Complete.ipynb
   ```

### Option 3: Python Script

```bash
python cars_analysis.py
```

##  Analysis Workflow

### 1. Data Preprocessing (30%)
- ✅ **Data Cleaning**:
  - Removed duplicates
  - Handled missing values (median for numeric, mode for categorical)
  - Outlier detection and removal using IQR method
  - Data type conversions

- ✅ **Feature Engineering**:
  - Created `car_age` feature
  - Created `price_category` feature

- ✅ **Descriptive Statistics**:
  - Summary statistics for numeric variables
  - Frequency distributions for categorical variables
  - Skewness and kurtosis analysis

- ✅ **Correlation Analysis**:
  - Pearson correlation matrix
  - Identified highly correlated variable pairs
  - Analyzed features correlated with selling price

### 2. Visualizations (20%)

#### Statistical Plots (6%):
1. **Correlation Heatmap** - Shows relationships between all numeric variables
2. **Price Distribution Analysis** - Histogram, box plot, Q-Q plot, violin plot
3. **Feature Importance** - Correlation with selling price

#### Relational Plots (7%):
4. **Scatter Plot with Regression** - Year vs Price relationship
5. **Multi-Variable Scatter** - km_driven vs Price by Fuel type
6. **Pairplot** - Pairwise relationships between numeric variables

#### Categorical Plots (7%):
7. **Fuel Type Analysis** - Count plot, bar plot, box plot, violin plot
8. **Transmission Analysis** - Bar plot with error bars, swarm plot
9. **Year-wise Trends** - Line plots and dual-axis charts
10. **Comprehensive Dashboard** - Multiple insights in one view

### 3. Key Insights

Based on the analysis, key findings include:

- **Price Trends**: Newer cars (2015+) command significantly higher prices
- **Fuel Type Impact**: Diesel cars have the highest average price
- **Transmission**: Automatic transmission cars are priced higher on average
- **Mileage Effect**: Higher km_driven correlates with lower prices (negative correlation)
- **Strong Correlations**: Year and engine size show moderate positive correlation with price
